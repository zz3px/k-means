# k-means
Implement and use a k-means clustering algorithm


Test k-means implementation by clustering the character data


Looking at how to improve modelâ€™s training time: the amount of time it takes for k-means to find the clusters via improving the speed that it computes centroids.


Create vectorized and parallelized versions of previous k-means code.
